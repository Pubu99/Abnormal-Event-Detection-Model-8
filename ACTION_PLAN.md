# 🎯 YOUR NEXT STEPS - Action Plan

## 📋 Immediate Actions (Next 30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies ⏱️ 10 minutes

Open PowerShell in your project directory:

```powershell
cd "e:\ENGINEERING\FOE-UOR\FYP\Model 8\Abnormal-Event-Detection-Model-8"

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.8 (for RTX 5090)
pip install torch==2.7.0+cu128 torchvision==0.22.0+cu128 torchaudio==2.7.0+cu128 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Install all other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected time:** 5-10 minutes (depending on internet speed)

---

### Step 2: Analyze Your Data 📊 ⏱️ 3 minutes

```powershell
python analyze_data.py
```

**What this shows:**

- ✅ Exact image count per class (Train & Test)
- ✅ Class distribution percentages
- ✅ Imbalance severity (ratio calculation)
- ✅ Class weights being used for balancing
- ✅ Visual charts saved to `outputs/results/data_distribution.png`

**Why this matters:** You need to understand your data before training! This verifies:

- Both Train and Test datasets are loaded correctly
- Class imbalance is identified and will be addressed
- Your data matches expectations (1.27M train, 111K test images)

---

### Step 3: Verify Setup ⏱️ 2 minutes

```powershell
python test_setup.py
```

**What to expect:**

- ✅ All imports successful
- ✅ CUDA detected (RTX 5090)
- ✅ Data loaded correctly from both Train and Test folders
- ✅ Model created successfully (5.8M parameters)

**If any test fails:** Check the error message and fix before proceeding.

---

### Step 4: Optional - Review Configuration ⏱️ 5 minutes

Open `configs/config.yaml` and review (you can leave defaults):

**Key settings to check:**

```yaml
data:
  root_dir: "data/raw" # ← Verify this path is correct

training:
  batch_size: 128 # ← Reduce to 64 if you get OOM errors
  epochs: 100 # ← Increase to 150 for better accuracy

hardware:
  device: "cuda" # ← Should be cuda for GPU training
```

---

### Step 5: Start Training! 🚀 ⏱️ 1 minute to start

```powershell
# Basic training
python train.py

# OR with Weights & Biases tracking (recommended)
python train.py --wandb
```

**After starting:**

- You'll see training progress in the terminal
- Model will train for ~25-30 hours
- You can leave it running overnight

---

## 📊 While Training (Monitor Progress)

### Option 1: TensorBoard (Local Monitoring)

Open a **NEW PowerShell window**:

```powershell
cd "e:\ENGINEERING\FOE-UOR\FYP\Model 8\Abnormal-Event-Detection-Model-8"
.\venv\Scripts\activate
tensorboard --logdir outputs/logs/
```

Then open browser: **http://localhost:6006**

**What to watch:**

- Training/Validation loss curves
- Accuracy trends
- Learning rate schedule

---

### Option 2: Weights & Biases (Cloud Monitoring)

If you started with `--wandb`, a browser tab will open automatically.

**What to watch:**

- Real-time metrics
- System metrics (GPU, CPU, Memory)
- Confusion matrices
- Model predictions

---

## ⏰ Training Timeline

### Hour 0-1: Initial Phase

- First epoch completes (~15-20 min)
- Loss drops rapidly
- Accuracy climbs to ~40-50%
- ✅ **Check:** GPU utilization should be 70-80%

### Hour 1-12: Fast Learning

- Epochs 1-40 complete
- Accuracy reaches 85-90%
- Loss continues to decrease
- ✅ **Check:** No errors in terminal

### Hour 12-24: Refinement

- Epochs 40-80 complete
- Accuracy: 92-94%
- Learning slows down
- ✅ **Check:** Validation accuracy still improving

### Hour 24-30: Final Tuning

- Epochs 80-100 complete
- Accuracy: 95%+ (target achieved!)
- Early stopping may trigger
- ✅ **Check:** Best model saved

---

## 🎯 After Training Completes

### Immediate Actions

**1. Check Training Log** ⏱️ 2 minutes

```powershell
# Find the log file
dir outputs\logs\ | sort LastWriteTime -Descending | select -First 1

# Open train.log in that directory
```

Look for:

- ✅ "Training completed"
- ✅ Best validation metrics
- ✅ No errors

**2. Evaluate on Test Set** ⏱️ 10 minutes

```powershell
# Find your best model checkpoint
python evaluate.py --checkpoint outputs/logs/baseline_v1_TIMESTAMP/checkpoints/best_model.pth --save-predictions
```

**3. Review Results** ⏱️ 15 minutes

Check `outputs/results/evaluation.txt`:

- Overall accuracy
- Per-class metrics
- Confusion matrix

**Look for:**

- ✅ Test accuracy > 95%
- ✅ F1-score > 0.93
- ✅ Good per-class performance

---

## 📈 If Results Are Good (>95% Accuracy)

Congratulations! 🎉 Your model is ready.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Document Results**

   - Screenshot confusion matrix
   - Save key metrics
   - Note training time

2. **Prepare for Report**

   - Use PROJECT_GUIDE.md for technical details
   - Include training curves
   - Show sample predictions

3. **Plan Phase 2** (Optional)
   - Real-time inference engine
   - Multi-camera integration
   - Backend API
   - Frontend application

## 🔧 If Results Need Improvement (<95% Accuracy)

### Quick Fixes

**If Accuracy is 90-94%:**

```powershell
# Train longer
python train.py --epochs 150
```

**If Accuracy is 85-90%:**

```yaml
# Edit configs/config.yaml
model:
  backbone:
    type: "efficientnet_b1" # Larger model

training:
  epochs: 150
  learning_rate: 0.0005 # Lower LR
```

**If Accuracy is <85%:**

- Check data loading (run test_setup.py)
- Verify labels are correct
- Review train.log for errors

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "CUDA out of memory"

**Solution 1:** Reduce batch size

```yaml
# configs/config.yaml
training:
  batch_size: 64 # or 32
```

**Solution 2:** Use gradient accumulation

```yaml
training:
  batch_size: 32
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 4 # Effective batch = 128
```

### Issue: Training is very slow

**Check 1:** GPU is being used

```powershell
nvidia-smi  # Should show python process using GPU
```

**Solution 1:** Increase workers

```yaml
data:
  num_workers: 16 # Increase from 8
```

**Solution 2:** Increase batch size

```yaml
training:
  batch_size: 256 # RTX 5090 can handle it
```

### Issue: "FileNotFoundError: data/raw/Train"

**Solution:** Verify data structure

```powershell
# Check if data exists
dir data\raw\Train
dir data\raw\Test

# Should show 14 folders in each
```

### Issue: Model not improving after epoch 30

**This is normal!**

- Learning slows down
- Small gains in later epochs
- Early stopping will trigger if no improvement

**If concerned:**

- Check validation loss is still decreasing
- Review TensorBoard curves
- May need to adjust learning rate
