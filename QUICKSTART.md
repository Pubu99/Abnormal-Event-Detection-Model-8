# 🎯 Quick Start Guide - Model Training

## ⚡ 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Install (5 minutes)

```powershell
# Clone/navigate to project directory
cd "e:\ENGINEERING\FOE-UOR\FYP\Model 8\Abnormal-Event-Detection-Model-8"

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup (2 minutes)

```powershell
# Run verification script
python test_setup.py
```

Expected output: **"ALL TESTS PASSED - READY TO TRAIN!"**

### Step 3: Start Training (Overnight)

```powershell
# Start training with default config
python train.py

# Or with W&B tracking
python train.py --wandb
```

**That's it!** Your model is now training. Come back in ~25-30 hours for a trained model.

## 📊 What Happens During Training?

### Real-Time Monitoring

**Option 1: TensorBoard** (Local)

```powershell
# Open new terminal
tensorboard --logdir outputs/logs/
# Open browser: http://localhost:6006
```

**Option 2: Weights & Biases** (Cloud)

```powershell
python train.py --wandb
# Dashboard opens automatically in browser
```

### What to Watch

1. **Training Loss**: Should decrease steadily
2. **Validation Accuracy**: Should reach >95% by epoch 50-70
3. **F1-Score**: Should stabilize around 0.93-0.95
4. **GPU Utilization**: Should be 70-80%

### Training Progress

```
Epoch 1/100:  Loss: 2.5432 | Acc: 45.2% | F1: 0.42
Epoch 10/100: Loss: 1.2341 | Acc: 78.5% | F1: 0.75
Epoch 30/100: Loss: 0.4523 | Acc: 92.1% | F1: 0.89
Epoch 50/100: Loss: 0.2134 | Acc: 95.8% | F1: 0.94 ✅
```

---

## 🎯 After Training Completes

### 1. Evaluate Model

```powershell
python evaluate.py --checkpoint outputs/logs/baseline_v1_TIMESTAMP/checkpoints/best_model.pth
```

### 2. Check Results

Look for:

- ✅ **Test Accuracy > 95%**
- ✅ **F1-Score > 0.93**
- ✅ **Per-class performance** (check confusion matrix)

### 3. Model Location

Your trained model is saved at:

```
outputs/logs/baseline_v1_TIMESTAMP/checkpoints/best_model.pth
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration (Optional)

Before training, you can customize `configs/config.yaml`:

### Common Tweaks

**Increase Training Speed:**

```yaml
training:
  batch_size: 256 # Increase from 128 (RTX 5090 can handle it)

data:
  num_workers: 16 # Increase from 8
```

**Longer Training (Better Accuracy):**

```yaml
training:
  epochs: 150 # Increase from 100
```

**Different Backbone:**

```yaml
model:
  backbone:
    type: "efficientnet_b1" # Larger model (slower but more accurate)
```

## ⏱️ Time Estimates (RTX 5090)

| Task                       | Duration      |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Setup & Installation       | 5-10 minutes  |
| Verification               | 2 minutes     |
| Single Epoch               | 15-20 minutes |
| Full Training (100 epochs) | 25-33 hours   |
| Evaluation                 | 5-10 minutes  |

**Plan accordingly!** Start training before bed or over a weekend.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your model is **ready for deployment** when:

✅ Test Accuracy > 95%
✅ F1-Score > 0.93
✅ No signs of overfitting (train/val gap < 5%)
✅ Inference time < 100ms per frame
✅ All anomaly classes have recall > 0.85

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "CUDA out of memory"

```yaml
# In configs/config.yaml
training:
  batch_size: 64 # Reduce from 128
```

**Problem**: Training is very slow

```yaml
# In configs/config.yaml
data:
  num_workers: 16 # Increase
training:
  batch_size: 256 # Increase (if memory allows)
```

**Problem**: Accuracy stuck at 60-70%

- Train longer (150 epochs)
- Check if data is loading correctly
- Verify labels are correct

**Problem**: Model not improving after epoch 30

- Early stopping will trigger automatically
- Check validation loss curve
- May need to adjust learning rate

## 📊 Expected Results

### Training Metrics (Final)

| Metric              | Expected Value |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Training Accuracy   | 96-99%         |
| Validation Accuracy | 95-97%         |
| Test Accuracy       | 95-96%         |
| F1-Score (macro)    | 0.93-0.95      |
| AUC-ROC             | 0.96-0.98      |

### Per-Class Performance

Most classes should achieve:

- Precision > 0.90
- Recall > 0.85
- F1-Score > 0.88

**Normal class** (most important):

- Precision > 0.95 (low false positives)
- Recall > 0.90 (catch most normal cases)
