## 🧠 Intelligent Fusion Engine

### Weighted Voting Architecture

The system uses **professional intelligent weighted fusion** to combine signals from 4 primary detection modalities with carefully tuned weights based on reliability:

| Modality             | Weight | Rationale                                 | Key Features                                            |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ML Model**         | 40%    | Domain-specific training on UCF Crime     | 14 classes, 99.38% accuracy, temporal modeling          |
| **Object Detection** | 25%    | Most reliable pre-training (COCO dataset) | YOLOv10/v8, real-time bounding boxes, weapons detection |
| **Pose Estimation**  | 20%    | Robust human behavior analysis            | MediaPipe 33 landmarks, fighting/falling detection      |
| **Motion Analysis**  | 15%    | Supporting evidence for dynamics          | Optical Flow, crowd panic, rapid movement               |

### Fusion Algorithm

The intelligent fusion engine combines detection signals through a multi-step process:

**Step 1:** Calculate individual modality scores (0.0 - 1.0) from each detection service

**Step 2:** Apply weighted fusion using the reliability-based weights (ML 40%, Objects 25%, Pose 20%, Motion 15%)

**Step 3:** Add consensus bonus (+0.15) when multiple modalities agree on anomaly presence

**Step 4:** Apply critical overrides for immediate threats:

- Weapon detected → Immediate CRITICAL alert
- Person falling detected → Upgrade score to 0.72
- High crowd density → Upgrade score to 0.75

**Step 5:** Threshold-based decision - only report anomalies with fusion score >= 0.70

### Override Logic (Safety-Critical Decision Rules)

The fusion engine implements **critical overrides** that bypass ML predictions for immediate threats:

#### **Rule 1: Weapon Detection Override** 🔴

If a dangerous weapon is detected (knife, gun, rifle, explosive), the system immediately triggers a CRITICAL alert with 100% confidence, bypassing all other scores and auto-saving screenshot evidence. Even if the ML model predicts "Normal" with high confidence, weapon detection always triggers a critical alert.

#### **Rule 2: Person Falling Detection** 🟠

When pose analysis detects a person falling with high confidence (>80%), or motion analysis detects a sudden fall (>70%), the system upgrades the fusion score to at least 0.72 (CRITICAL threshold), overriding any ML "Normal" prediction. This is crucial for detecting medical emergencies, such as an elderly person falling, where the ML might miss the urgency but pose and motion sensors detect the anomaly.

#### **Rule 3: Consensus Validation** 🟡

When an anomaly is detected and multiple modalities (2 or more) agree, the system adds a consensus bonus of +0.15 to the fusion score. This increases confidence in the detection and reduces false positives. For example, if ML predicts "Fighting", pose detects a fighting stance, and motion detects rapid movement, all three agreeing increases confidence significantly.

#### **Rule 4: High Crowd Density** 🟡

When the person count exceeds 15 and object detection confidence is 100%, the system upgrades the fusion score to at least 0.75, triggering a crowd safety monitoring alert even if the ML model predicts normal activity. This is essential for public gathering monitoring where high crowd density requires attention.

### Anomaly Severity Levels

The system uses four severity thresholds:

- **NORMAL** (0.00-0.30): Safe, routine activity
- **SUSPICIOUS** (0.30-0.50): Unusual but not immediately threatening
- **ABNORMAL** (0.50-0.70): Concerning behavior requiring attention
- **CRITICAL** (0.70-1.00): Immediate threat, security response needed

The system only reports detections with fusion scores >= 0.70 (CRITICAL threshold). It does not highlight "Normal" activity—the system is designed to detect threats, not routine behavior. All CRITICAL alerts include detailed reasoning and screenshot evidence.

### Transparency & Explainable AI

Every anomaly detection includes comprehensive reasoning for transparency. The JSON response provides:

- Final decision and severity level
- Fusion score and overall confidence
- Anomaly type and human-readable explanation
- Detailed score breakdown showing each modality's contribution (ML: 40%, YOLO: 25%, Pose: 20%, Motion: 15%)
- Individual detection details from each modality
- Reasoning chain explaining the decision
- Consensus information (agreement count and bonus)
- Critical override status and reason (if applicable)

This transparency allows security personnel to understand exactly why an alert was triggered and trust the system's decision-making process.

### Detection Philosophy

1. **Anomaly-Only Reporting**: System only reports CRITICAL anomalies (fusion_score >= 0.70), not "Normal" activity
2. **Redundancy by Design**: 4 independent modalities provide cross-validation and reduce false negatives
3. **Critical Override Priority**: Immediate threats (weapons) bypass ML predictions for safety
4. **Transparent Reasoning**: Every decision includes detailed score breakdown and human-readable explanation
5. **Consensus Validation**: Multiple modalities agreeing increases confidence and reduces false positives

## 🔬 Training the Model

### Prerequisites for Training

**Requirements:**

- Python: 3.9+
- PyTorch: 2.7.0 with CUDA support
- RAM: 16GB+ recommended
- GPU: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (better GPUs reduce training time significantly)
- Storage: 800GB+ for UCF Crime dataset
- Time: ~2-3 hours per training run (with good GPU)

### Training Steps Overview

#### Step 1: Download UCF Crime Dataset

The UCF Crime dataset contains 1,610 videos (~800GB) across 14 categories. Visit the official website or use the provided download script to obtain the complete dataset with all 14 anomaly categories plus NormalVideos.

**Dataset Structure:**

- Train folder: 14 class folders (Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault, Burglary, Explosion, Fighting, RoadAccidents, Robbery, Shooting, Shoplifting, Stealing, Vandalism, NormalVideos)
- Test folder: Same 14 class folders

#### Step 2: Preprocess Dataset (Optional)

The preprocessing script extracts frames from videos at 2 fps (configurable) for faster training. This saves time during the training process by avoiding repeated video decoding. Processed frames are saved to the data/processed directory.

#### Step 3: Configure Training

Edit the configuration file at `configs/config_research_enhanced.yaml` to customize training parameters. Key configurations include:

- Training parameters: epochs (100), batch size (64), learning rate (0.0001), gradient accumulation steps (2)
- Model backbone: EfficientNet-B0 (options: b0-b3), pretrained on ImageNet
- Temporal components: BiLSTM hidden dimensions (256), layers (2), Transformer layers (2), attention heads (8)
- Data settings: sequence length (16 frames), input resolution (224x224)

#### Step 4: Start Training

First verify your setup using the test script, then start training with the research-enhanced configuration. The training process will load the dataset, create frame sequences, initialize the model with pretrained EfficientNet weights, train with multi-task learning, save checkpoints to the outputs directory, and display real-time progress with metrics.

The training typically shows progressive improvement over epochs, with the model achieving high accuracy (98%+) within 15-20 epochs. The best model is automatically saved based on validation performance.

#### Step 5: Monitor Training

**TensorBoard Monitoring (Recommended):**
Launch TensorBoard in a separate terminal pointing to the outputs/logs directory. Access the web interface at localhost:6006 to view loss curves, accuracy metrics, learning rate schedules, and confusion matrices in real-time.

**Weights & Biases (Optional):**
If configured, W&B automatically tracks training metrics and provides cloud-based visualization and experiment tracking.

**Console Output:**
The training script displays rich console output with real-time progress, and all metrics are logged to outputs/logs/training.log for later review.

#### Step 6: Evaluate Model

Use the evaluation script to test the best trained model on the test set. This provides detailed performance metrics including:

# Generate detailed analysis

python evaluate_research.py --model outputs/checkpoints/best.pth --detailed

The evaluation will output detailed metrics including test accuracy (99.38%), precision, recall, and F1-scores for all classes. Per-class results show F1-scores for each category (e.g., NormalVideos: 99.53%, Stealing: 99.62%, Assault: 99.53%, etc.).

#### Step 7: Create Visualizations

Use the visualization script to generate comprehensive performance visualizations. Outputs are saved to outputs/visualizations/ and include confusion matrices, ROC curves, PR curves, class-wise performance charts, and training history plots.

#### Step 8: Deploy Model

Copy the best trained model from outputs/checkpoints/best.pth to models/best_model.pth for deployment. Verify the model loads correctly using the AnomalyDetector class, then start the backend server to use the newly trained model for inference.

### Training Tips and Best Practices

**GPU Memory Management:**
If encountering out-of-memory errors, reduce the batch size (e.g., to 32 or 16) and increase gradient accumulation steps (to 4) to maintain the effective batch size.

**Handling Overfitting:**
Increase regularization by adjusting dropout rates (e.g., to 0.6) and augmentation parameters like random erasing probability (e.g., to 0.5).

**Addressing Slow Convergence:**
Adjust the learning rate schedule by increasing the initial learning rate (e.g., to 0.0002) or reducing warmup epochs (e.g., to 5).

**Tackling Class Imbalance:**
Fine-tune the Focal Loss parameters by increasing gamma (e.g., to 3.0) for harder focus on difficult examples, and use auto-computed class weights.

### Alternative Training Options

The project includes several training scripts for different purposes:

- Standard training without research enhancements using the base configuration
- Setup validation script to verify environment before training
- Model component testing scripts for individual module validation
- Integration testing for full pipeline verification

### Resume Training

Training can be resumed from a saved checkpoint if interrupted, maintaining all optimizer states and learning rate schedules. Models can also be fine-tuned from pretrained weights by loading a checkpoint as the starting point.

For complete training methodology and hyperparameter details, see [TRAINING_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/TRAINING_METHODOLOGY.md)

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Backend Configuration

The main configuration file `config.yaml` controls:

- Model settings: path to weights, device (cuda/cpu), sequence length
- Fusion engine: detection weights (ML: 0.50, YOLO: 0.25, Pose: 0.15, Motion: 0.10)
- Thresholds: normal (0.3), suspicious (0.5), abnormal (0.7)
- Server settings: host, port, reload options

### Frontend Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory to configure:

- Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
- WebSocket URL (default: ws://localhost:8000/ws/stream)
- Screenshot storage limit
- Timeline display length

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**ModuleNotFoundError:**
Ensure the virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed via the backend requirements file.

**CUDA Out of Memory:**
Either reduce batch size in the configuration or switch to CPU mode by changing the device setting.

**WebSocket Connection Failed:**
Verify the backend is running on the correct port (8000) and check for port conflicts.

### Frontend Issues

**Cannot Connect to Backend:**
Verify the backend URL in the frontend .env file matches where the backend is running.

**Camera Not Working:**
Check browser permissions for camera access in browser settings (e.g., Chrome Settings → Privacy → Camera).

**npm Install Fails:**
Clear the npm cache and delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then reinstall dependencies.
